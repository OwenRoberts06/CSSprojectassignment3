      <!--paragraphs with supertext to better show half year, breaks to keep text on page and spans to highlight names of bands-->
      <p>
        One of my main hobby's is guitar, I've been playing guitar for eight</br>
        years now. For most of those years I was playing classical guitar though</br>
        I made the switch to electric guitar about 1<sup>1/2</sup> years. I enjoy playing metal</br>
          music and also like to listen to music all the time. I mainly listen to</br>
         metal and enjoy <span id="bandSpan">Slipknot</span> and <span id="bandSpan">Avenged sevenfold</span> the most out of the bands I like.
      </p>
      <h3 class="headingFont">Video Games</h3>
      <p>One of my other main hobbies is playing video games, the games I mainly play are</br> 
        League of Legends, Sea of thieves, Minecraft, Valorant and Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six</br>
         Siege. I enjoy working with other people in these games though I also enjoy singleplayer games.</p>
